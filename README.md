# VST 3 VOID Project Generator 

I forked the VST3 Project Generator at (https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3projectgenerator)  
Windows+VSCode

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Features added 

* Project now builds with a .vscode folder with tasks.json to clean+compile+build and launch.json to debug (set up for ableton)
* Sets up a bypass parameter and demonstrates the complete logic for adding more
* Manages setting bus arangements manually and exposes params not available at initialize
* Includes the following tools, *should* compile properly:
    * FFTW64 (https://www.fftw.org/)
    * DSP Filters (details: https://github.com/vinniefalco/DSPFilters)
* Includes basic C++ .gitignore which prevents the LicenseSpring VST SDK from pushing as its OS/configuration dependent. Simply download the corresponding SDK from https://docs.licensespring.com/sdks/cpp if the one here isn't correct. In my code, it is LicenseSpringCppSDK-v7.41.0-VC142.zip.
* LicenseSpring tools can be found in the LicenseSpring-Tutorials folder and implimenting them is extremely straightforwards (details: https://github.com/kbrandon17/LicenseSpring-SampleProjects)
* Editor is overrided to give control
* EditorDelegate allows for deep UI control and allows listeners to be applied to UI objects created from editor.uidesc

## How to Build and Use the project generator
Either download or clone and cd into the repo then create a build folder. From in the build folder:
```
cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..
cmake --build . --config Release  
```
Then the project generator will be in ROOT/build/Release/VST3_Project_Generator/VST3_Project_Generator.exe

From here it acts exactly like the old generator and even remembers your preferences/paths. Takes a lot longer to build but its worth it.  

Definitely unlink or remove all the libraries you aren't using so you dont compile a ton of bloatware. If you really don't want something in the project, just delete the folder from the \script\cmake\templates in the Project Generator Root, then edit script\cmake\templates\vst3plugin_folder\CMakeLists.txt.in to remove the linking to the associated libary, then rebuild the Project Generator.


## LicenseSpring Notes

To use LicenseSpring features within a project (not implimented in the template), it takes some more setting up. I am compiling with MSVC with "-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path\to\msvc_toolchain.cmake" as I need the following libraries to complete an online node unlocking:

* libcurl         (https://curl.se/libcurl/)
* OpenSSL         (https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html)
* yubico-piv-tool (https://github.com/Yubico/yubico-piv-tool/)

Simple way to add them to the toolchain is using vcpkg (https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg), then when its added as a global executable:
```
vcpkg install curl openssl:x64-windows
vcpkg integrate install
```
You can now use.
```
find_package(CURL REQUIRED)
find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)
```
to find the libraries in your CMakeLists.txt. 

yubico-piv-tool is a bit more tedious. You can download the windows binary directly (https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool/Releases/) or follow the steps here (https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-piv-tool/).

# VST 3 Project Generator


## Introduction


With this little application you can easily create a new **VST 3** plug-in project by simply entering some parameters into a GUI (Win/macOS).  
Linux users can generate a new plug-in project by [running the cmake script directly](https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3projectgenerator/tree/master/script).

## How to clone and build

```Example
git clone https://github.com/steinbergmedia/vst3projectgenerator.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -GXcode ../vst3projectgenerator
cmake --build .
```

## Project Structure

The **VST 3 Project Generator** repository contains an app that uses [VSTGUI](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_dev_portal/pages/What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/VSTGUI.html) and a cmake script that the app calls.

## Online Documentation

Please visit the [VST 3 Project Generator](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_dev_portal/pages/What+is+the+VST+3+SDK/Project+Generator.html).

## Usage guidelines

More details are found at [Usage guidelines](https://steinbergmedia.github.io/vst3_dev_portal/pages/VST+3+Licensing/Usage+guidelines.html).
